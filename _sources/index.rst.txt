SYCL Examples
=============

Welcome to SYCL Examples' documentation !

SYCL is a royalty-free, cross-platform, C++ programming model for heterogeneous
computing :cite:`sycl2020`.
SYCL is built on parallel APIs such as OpenCL :cite:`khronos_opencl_registry`,
CUDA :cite:`nvidia_cuda_guide`, and HIP :cite:`amd_hip_guide`.
These underlying parallel APIs are denoted as *backends* in SYCL.
SYCL extends the concepts found in these backends and enable their use through
modern C++.
