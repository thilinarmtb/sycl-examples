SYCL Examples
=============

Welcome to SYCL Examples' documentation !

SYCL is a royalty-free, cross-platform, generic C++ programming model for
heterogeneous computing :cite:`sycl_2020`.
This is the accompanying documentation for the SYCL examples found in the
sycl-examples_ repository.

SYCL terminology
----------------
A *SYCL application* is a C++ application which uses the SYCL programming
model and run on a host system.
SYCL is built on top of parallel programming models such as OpenCL
:cite:`khronos_opencl_registry`, CUDA :cite:`nvidia_cuda_guide`, and HIP
:cite:`amd_hip_guide`.
These programming models are exposed as *SYCL backends* :cite:`sycl_2020`.
SYCL backend implementations are built on these programming models and
enable their use in modern C++ with the *SYCL backend API*.

A *SYCL device* is an abstraction of a piece of hardware that can be used by
a SYCL application :cite:`sycl_2020`.
A function that can execute on a SYCL device exposed by a SYCL backend API is
called a *SYCL kernel function* :cite:`sycl_2020`.
A *SYCL platform*: a collection of SYCL devices managed by a single SYCL
backend :cite:`sycl_2020`.
A *SYCL context* encapsulates the runtime data structures and states required
by a SYCL backend API to interact with SYCL devices associated with a given
SYCL platform.
A *SYCL runtime* is an implementation of the SYCL API specification which
can be used to manage SYCL platforms, devices and contexts as well as handling
data/memory management on the host and the SYCL backend :cite:`sycl_2020`.
*SYCL accessors* are used for data/memory management in a SYCL application.

A *SYCL application scope* starts with the construction of the first SYCL
runtime instance in the SYCL application and finishes with the destruction
of the last one.
A SYCL application scope could contain one or more *SYCL command group scopes*.
A SYCL command group scope is defined as a unit of work which is comprised of
a SYCL kernel function (also known as *SYCL kernel scope*) and SYCL accessors.
A *SYCL command queue* (or simply a *SYCL queue*) is an abstraction that is
used to execute SYCL command groups using a SYCL runtime on a SYCL device.
