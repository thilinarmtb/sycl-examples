Device Discovery with SYCL
==========================

This example is based on :cite:`intel_device_discovery_with_sycl` and illustrates
how to use SYCL backend API to identify and query the information regarding the
devices available for computing.
A backend exposes one or more *platforms* (a platform is a collection of devices
managed by a single backend).
